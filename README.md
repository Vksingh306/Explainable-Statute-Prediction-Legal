# Explainable-Statute-Prediction-Legal
Given a case situation, explainable statute prediction is an important and challenging problem. In this paper,we perform a preliminary study to understand the complexity of the statute prediction task and the difficulty in incorporating human explanations into the framework. The task turns out to be more complicated for the legal domain. In this paper, we report initial results and motivate to solve the task by considering explanations provided by the legal experts as an integral part of the model.
